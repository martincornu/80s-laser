# Laser - Receiver

The goal of the project is to activate an output when a laser is detected by its receiver. The distance between the two is about 8m. The laser should be visible if possible (e.g. smoke). The laser is turned off and on only when the CAB scan puzzle is solved. The player must then remove an obstacle and aim the laser so that it is detected by the receiver. 

It activates a relay + magnet.

Provide an emergency button with about 5m of wire to activate the laser by the game master.
